# {frontmatter.title}

Hmmm... This is a sensitive and complex topic to address, especially before securing a place in the on-campus placement drive, but the process has truly humbled me.
Watching random people get placed through cheating and malpractice has shaken both my self-confidence and my perspective on life.
With my Commvault interview just two days away, the pressure isn't easing, but bingeing The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance has offered much-needed solace.
I’ve come to realize that Journey before Destination is the way forward. The strength to uphold what is right must always come before giving in to weakness.

This is only the start of my career. Temporary salary increments, which often become negligible in just two years, have already corrupted many of my batchmates.
I want to resist that fate. My career as a software engineer will likely not be replaced by overhyped transformer models for at least a few decades.
The algorithms and strategies I’m learning now will not only help in my daily work but also in building Pariah and the creative coding projects I will pursue in the future.

## Luck

Well luck indeed plays a huge role, but it is indeed not as big as I had come to believe at first.

It’s those seemingly random, quantum-like occurrences that can make an interviewer take a liking to you instantly.
This largely depends on the interviewer, but starting with a friendly "Good Morning," asking, "How was the commute?" or "Did you enjoy the campus?" can help test the waters and let you pace yourself.
The candidates who interview before and after you also affect the outcome. Sometimes, choosing your slot wisely, or strategically using the SPC role, can help bypass certain roadblocks.
Regardless of how well your interview goes, flexing those dormant extroverted muscles will help you in future interviews.
After all, every interview feels like it could be the last in a long series, and each one builds your momentum.

## Confidence

Confidence is key, especially in an interview setting.
When answering, it’s crucial to believe in your response, even if you’re uncertain.
Interviews aren’t the time for deep contemplation or proof-building—that can come later.
If you can engage in small talk while coding or answering questions, it can ease the tension on both sides.

One thing I’ve noticed is that if you, after studying operating systems or networking concepts just last year, struggle to recall certain details, it’s likely your interviewer—who studied them years ago—may also not remember everything in depth, unless they use it daily.
Going with your first instinct and then iterating on your answer shows that you can think through edge cases and possible scenarios in a production environment.
For data structures and algorithms (DSA), starting with a brute-force solution gives you a foundation to build upon.
From there, you can move toward a more optimized solution. This approach buys you time and makes tackling edge cases much easier.

## Preparation

Preparation is the most critical part of any interview or online assessment.
I like to compare it to the preparation a chess Grandmaster does before a match.
Revisiting everything you’ve studied and heard about is essential.
At least three days of focused preparation is required.
Being analytical and thinking from first principles will help, even if you don’t know the correct answer right away.
Displaying analytical thinking can leave a strong impression on your interviewer.

Grokking system design and algorithms, especially standard dynamic programming (DP) and graph questions on [cses.fi](https://cses.fi) and *TUF*, will help you navigate the final ravine in these job-hunting badlands.
But ultimately, it’s important to remember:

> "The only way to go fast is to go well."

Perhaps, like Klein Moretti from Lord of the Mysteries, you’ll discover that Fate in system design sometimes hides its own Sequence of challenges, and only by embracing both chaos and order in algorithms can you ascend to a higher understanding.
