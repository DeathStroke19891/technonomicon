Blazingly fast ways to find all primes within a range.

## Sieve of Erastosthenes

Sieve of Erastosthenes is an algorithm for finding all the prime numbers in a segment \[1,n]  using O(_n_ log log _n_) operations. Just your basic sieve, can probably find an explanation elsewhere.

### Sieving till root

Optimisation of Sieve of Erastosthenes, by optimising it until the root of max N. 

```c++
int n;
vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (is_prime[i]) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
            is_prime[j] = false;
    }
}
```
Can be further optimised by i incrementing by 2 and making sure that only odd numbers are considered.

## Segmented Sieve

+ Optimised for cache stores in memory.
+ Sieved normally until sqrt(n)
+ Then use blocks of fixed size to find the rest of the primes
+ Is efficient only if n is very large and S is of the order 10<sup>5</sup>

```c++
int count_primes(int n) {
    const int S = 10000;

    // Sieve until sqrt(n)
    vector<int> primes;
    int nsqrt = sqrt(n);
    vector<char> is_prime(nsqrt + 2, true);
    for (int i = 2; i <= nsqrt; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            primes.push_back(i);
            for (int j = i * i; j <= nsqrt; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }


    // Find the rest of the primes by dividing the whole range in blocks of size S, which is then sieved again.
    // Lower amount of memory required and optimised as a block is extracted at once and cache misses are less.
    int result = 0;
    vector<char> block(S);
    for (int k = 0; k * S <= n; k++) {
        fill(block.begin(), block.end(), true);
        int start = k * S;
        for (int p : primes) {
            int start_idx = (start + p - 1) / p;
            int j = max(start_idx, p) * p - start;
            for (; j < S; j += p)
                block[j] = false;
        }
        if (k == 0)
            block[0] = block[1] = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < S && start + i <= n; i++) {
            if (block[i])
                result++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Find prime numbers in a range \[L,R]

Same as segmented sieve partially. Sieve untill sqrt(R), and then find all primes in the range \[L,R]

```c++
vector<char> segmentedSieve(long long L, long long R) {
    // generate all primes up to sqrt(R)
    long long lim = sqrt(R);
    vector<char> mark(lim + 1, false);
    vector<long long> primes;
    for (long long i = 2; i <= lim; ++i) {
        if (!mark[i]) {
            primes.emplace_back(i);
            for (long long j = i * i; j <= lim; j += i)
                mark[j] = true;
        }
    }

    // Find primes in range [L,R]
    // start = L; S = R
    vector<char> isPrime(R - L + 1, true);
    for (long long i : primes)
        for (long long j = max(i * i, (L + i - 1) / i * i); j <= R; j += i)
            isPrime[j - L] = false;
    if (L == 1)
        isPrime[0] = false;
    return isPrime;
}
```

## Linear Sieve

Generally slower than segmented sieve as it has a large constant factor. 

But Linear Sieve is the honoured one.
Seemingly impossible algorithm, with a concise implementation.
Each number is visited only once and also gives the factorisation of the number in linear time.

```c++
const int N = 10000000;
vector<int> lp(N+1);
vector<int> pr;

for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {
    if (lp[i] == 0) {
        lp[i] = i;
        pr.push_back(i);
    }
    for (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {
        lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
        if (pr[j] == lp[i]) {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

The proof for this beautiful algorithm is a bit tricky and needs some thought. 
I will probably never be able to explain it in all its glory but at least I can try.

```
For a given number i, we find i*pr[j] for all pr[j] <= lp[i].
This fills the lp vector for all numbers which are multiples of i and have a prime factor <= lp[i].
The factorisation of a number i*pr[j] will be lp[i]*k*pr[j] where pr[j] <= lp[i] <= k.
Hence each number is set exactly once as there can only be one unique factorisation with lp of that number.
One more thing to be noted here is that you always set numbers which are greater than i, so repeatitions are not possible.
```

This algorithm allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment  \[2; n]  in the time of the size order of this factorization. 
Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.
Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.
