So Diophantine Equations...

My first encounter with Diophantine Equations was probably in my first year during Cirquit recruitment test.
I was asked to solve a problem and having forgotten how to do modular arithmetic and find GCDs (Thank you JEE), sat and derived some crazy complicated equations to solve the problem.
Right after that I had a Coding Club interview where I was asked to find the GCD of two numbers. Hmmm..., I just did this, let me do it again I thought.
Shivam Birajdhar who was my interviewer told, hmmm... you are solving a diophantine equation and I was like "What??"

Diophantus of Alexandria, who wrote _Arithmatica_, which had a lot of equations involving solutions which need to be positive integers. Since then these classes of equations have been known as Diophantine equations.
Some diophantine equations can only be solved using p-adic numbers, which is probably the craziest concept I know till now on its own.

A Diophantine equation is an equation relating integer (or sometimes natural number or whole number) quanitites.
Finding the solution or solutions to a Diophantine equation is closely tied to modular arithmetic and number theory.
Often, when a Diophantine equation has infinitely many solutions, parametric form is used to express the relation between the variables of the equation.

A Linear Diophantine equation in two variables takes the form of _ax + by = c_, where x, y ∈ ℤ and a,b,c are integer constants, x and y are unknown variables.
There can possibly exist infinite solutions for some linear diophantine equations in 2 variables and can be solved through a variation of Bézout's identity.
Linear Diophantine Equations in 3 or more variables also make use of Bézout's identity extensively to find solutions.

The most famous of the non linear Diophantine equations are the pythagorean triplets where equations of the form x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>.
A general form of this is what makes up Fermat's Last Theorem which was solved by Andrew Wiles using symmetries in the algebraic geometry of elliptic curves.

The focus of this article is on solving a particular type of Diophantine equations using Simon's Factoring Trick where given equations of the type
ab + 2a + 3b = n can be solved quite easily using some clever algebraic manipulation.

The solution/method is as follows:
