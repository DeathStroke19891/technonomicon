## Where?

Given an array `A` and `Q` queries of two types:
1. [_i_, x]  where the update `A[i]=x` has to be performed.
2. [L<sub>i</sub>,R<sub>i</sub>] where the f(L<sub>i</sub>,...,R<sub>i</sub>) is to be performed.

when the value of f(L<sub>i</sub>,...,R<sub>i</sub>) = f(0,...,R<sub>i</sub>) - f(0,...,L<sub>i</sub>-1)

## Why?

A brute force solution would be to loop over each element for each query but this takes O(NQ) time.

Sparse Tables cannot be used as they work only no immutable arrays and cannot handle point and range updates.
This problem can be solved by using

1. Fenwick or Binary Indexed Trees

   Complexity of O(log N) but not efficient for range updates and only support for prefix sum style queries

2. Seqment Trees

   Complexity of O(log N), efficient for range updates and other types of queries but with a higher space complexity of O(4*N)

3. Sqrt Decomposition and Sqrt Trees

   Better universality and easier implementation and debugging complexity at the cost of O(√N) time complexity

## What?

The Fenwick tree is a data structure which:
+ Calculates the value of function f in the given range [L<sub>i</sub>,R<sub>i</sub>] in O(log N) time
+ Updates the value of an element of `A` in O(log N) time
+ Requires O(N) memory (the same amount required for `A`)
+ Is easy to use and code, especially in the case of multidimensional arrays

All queries are decomposed into prefix sum style queries which are then subtracted to obtain the desired result.


Fenwick trees can also be modified to handle range_update-point_query and range_update-range_query also.

## How?

Suppose we are given an array of integers, A[0,...,N-1].
A Fenwick tree is just an array, T[0,...,N-1], where each element is equal to the sum of elements of A in some range, [g(i), i] where g is some function that satisfies 0≤g(i)≤i.

Below is some pseudo code for the two operations sum and increase. Below, we get the sum of elements of A in the range [0, r] and update (increase) some element A<sub>i</sub>:

```c++
def sum(int r):
    res = 0
    while (r >= 0):
        res += t[r]
        r = g(r) - 1
    return res

def increase(int i, int delta):
    for all j with g(j) <= i <= j:
        t[j] += delta
```


The complexity of both sum and increase depend on the function g.
There are many ways to choose the function g such that 0≤g(i)≤i for all i.
For instance, the function g(i) = i works, which yields T = A (in which case, the summation queries are slow).
We could also take the function g(i) = 0. This would correspond to prefix sum arrays (in which case, finding the sum of the range [0, i] will only take constant time; however, updates are slow).
The clever part of the algorithm for Fenwick trees is how it uses a special definition of the function g which can handle both operations in O(log N) time.


The Implemenation of a Fenwick Tree is as below, where g(i) = r & r + 1 and h(i) = idx | (idx + 1) where h(i) recursivly gives all j such that g(j) ≤ i ≤ j.

```c++
struct FenwickTree {
    vector<int> bit;  // binary indexed tree
    int n;

    FenwickTree(int n) {
        this->n = n;
        bit.assign(n, 0);
    }

    FenwickTree(vector<int> const &a) : FenwickTree(a.size()){
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            bit[i] += a[i];
            int r = i | (i + 1);
            if (r < n) bit[r] += bit[i];
        }
    }

    // O(n lg n) Implementation
    // FenwickTree(vector<int> const &a) : FenwickTree(a.size()) {
    //     for (size_t i = 0; i < a.size(); i++)
    //         add(i, a[i]);
    // }

    int sum(int r) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (; r >= 0; r = (r & (r + 1)) - 1)
            ret += bit[r];
        return ret;
    }

    int sum(int l, int r) {
        return sum(r) - sum(l - 1);
    }

    void add(int idx, int delta) {
        for (; idx < n; idx = idx | (idx + 1))
            bit[idx] += delta;
    }
};
```

With one based indexing, the operations sum and add change accordingly

```c++
struct FenwickTreeOneBasedIndexing {
    vector<int> bit;  // binary indexed tree
    int n;

    FenwickTreeOneBasedIndexing(int n) {
        this->n = n + 1;
        bit.assign(n + 1, 0);
    }

    FenwickTreeOneBasedIndexing(vector<int> a)
        : FenwickTreeOneBasedIndexing(a.size()) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < a.size(); i++)
            add(i, a[i]);
    }

    int sum(int r) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (++r; r > 0; r -= r & -r)
            ret += bit[r];
        return ret;
    }

    int sum(int l, int r) {
        return sum(r) - sum(l - 1);
    }

    void add(int idx, int delta) {
        for (++idx; idx < n; idx += idx & -idx)
            bit[idx] += delta;
    }
};
```

The main benefit of using this approach is the fact the operations for g(i) and h(i) complement each other nicely.

## When?

I came across this when reading the editorial of Educational Codeforces Round 168 - Level Up where I saw one crazy long editorial using segment trees, BIT or ordered set from pbds.
I gave up and decided to atleast understand what these data structures mean.
