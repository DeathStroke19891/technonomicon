## Where?

Given an array of length N, answer Q queries of the form [L<sub>i</sub>, R<sub>i</sub>].
For each query q, find the value of f(L<sub>i</sub>,L<sub>i</sub>+1,...,R<sub>i</sub>).
The function f can vary according to the problem, e.g. min(..), sum(...).

## Why?

The bruteforce appoarch would be to loop over all the element from L<sub>i</sub> to R<sub>i</sub> and apply the function f on them.
This approach would have a time complexity of O(N*Q). This is horrible for all practical reasons.

To solve this we have several ways
1. Segment tree(O(Q*log _n_) time and O(n) space)
2. Sparse Table(O(Q) time and O(nlog _n_) space with O(nlog _n_) preprocessing time)
3. Disjoint Sparse Table
4. Sqrt trees and Sqrt decomposition

Both Segment trees and Sqrt trees are overkill for this problem unless there are very tight time constraints. Hence for range queries on immutable arrays, sparse tables are generally used.

## What?

<More>
Sparse Table is a data structure, that allows answering range queries.
It can answer most range queries in O(log n), but its true power is answering range minimum queries (or equivalent range maximum queries).
For those queries it can compute answer in O(1) time.

The only drawback of this data structure is, that it can only be used on immutable arrays. This means, that the array cannot be changed between two queries.
If any element changes, the complete data structure has to be recomputed

Sparse tables can compute answers for range queries involving idempotent functions in O(1), and associative functions in O(log _n_).

Disjoint Sparse Table and Sqrt Trees overcome this problem and solve for even associative functions in O(1).

## How?

The intuition behind sparse tables is the fact that intervals can be represented as the union of smaller intervals of size 2<sup>i</sup>.
For example [2,15] = [2,9]<sub>(size 8)</sub> ∪ [10, 13]<sub>(size 4)</sub> ∪ [14, 15]<sub>(size 2)</sub>.

### Preprocessing

We will use a 2-dimensional array for storing the answers to the pre computed queries in a table st[i][j] where an entry st<sub>i,j</sub> represents the answer for the interval [j,j+2<sup>i</sup>-1].
We use dynammic programming to compute the table in O(nlog _n_) time.
``` c++
std::copy(array.begin(), array.end(), st[0]);

for (int i = 1; i <= K; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j + (1 << i) <= N; j++)
        st[i][j] = f(st[i - 1][j], st[i - 1][j + (1 << (i - 1))]);

```

### Range Queries

For each query q, we can process the query in O(log _n_) time for associative functions and O(1) for idempotent functions.
For associative functions split the given interval into smaller subintervals of size according to decreasing powers of 2 and answer them.

But the sparse tables really shine with their use for idempotent functions where, overlapping sub-intervals of size i do not make a difference.
``` c++
int i = lg[R - L + 1];
int minimum = min(st[i][L], st[i][R - (1 << i) + 1]);
```

## When?

For no particular reason I was reading about sparse tables on [here](https://cp-algorithms.com).
