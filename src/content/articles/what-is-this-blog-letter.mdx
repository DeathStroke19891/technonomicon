Somewhere along the way we all agreed a blog should look one particular way. This caused all of the web to take a similar shape. And that way kindof sucks.
I wanted something where emphasis was on typography and content more than graphics and styling while coping with the pace of modern life.
This was when I found out about formatting blog in the form of issues and articles like print media. Because of this is has a large focus on text, and how ideas connect to each other.
It instantly appealed to me and I have decided to give it a go.

> [-nomicon: Used to form nouns, referring to a book of knowledge on the specified topic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-nomicon)

Hence, this *Technonomicon* is a blog-letter where I might release issues monthly or whenever I have sufficient content about my adventures and musings.
